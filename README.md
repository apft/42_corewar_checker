#### TL;DR
```
# Run a set of unit tests on your asm (assume it is in the parent directory)
$ ./asm_checker.sh ../asm

# Check for potential leaks (requires valgrind)
$ ./asm_checker.sh -l ../asm

# Run only the tests for the live op
$ ./asm_checker.sh -l ../asm champs/unit_tests/test_op/01_live*.s

# Check your corewar against a set of .cor file (assume your executable is in the parent directory)
$ ./vm_checker.sh ../corewar champs/bytecode/*.cor

# Check for potential leaks
$ ./vm_checker.sh -l ../corewar champs/bytecode/*.cor

# Set the timeout to 20 seconds and check for leaks
$ ./vm_checker.sh -lt 20 ../corewar champs/bytecode/*.cor

# Convert .s files first with the 42 asm bin
$ ./vm_checker.sh -blt 20 ../corewar champs/unit_tests/**/*.s

# Same as the previous one but use your asm file
$ ./vm_checker.sh -blt 20 -B ../asm ../corewar champs/**/*.{s,cor}

# Run 25 fights (1vs1) with your champion against random champions
$ ./vm_checker.sh -f 25 -m 2 -p ../your_champion.s ../corewar champs/bytecode/*.cor

# Run the dump checker with default clean options with two champions
$ ./dump_checker.sh ../corewar champs/bytecode/zork.s champs/bytecode/ultima.cor
````

## Asm checker

Assuming your `asm` file is in the parent directory, you can run the set of unit tests with the following command
```
./asm_checker.sh ../asm
```

If you want to check for potential leaks (requires valgrind)
```
./asm_checker.sh -l ../asm
```
Finally if you like to run only some tests, you can define the path to each test. For instance to run only the unit test of the `live` operation do as follow
```
./asm_checker.sh -l ../asm champs/unit_tests/test_op/01_live*.s
```

#### Ouptut
We tried to make the output of the script as easy as possible.
* `success` : both program created a _.cor_ file and their content is similar
* `good` : both program encounter an error, each error is displayed on the shell
* `segfault` : one of the program encounter a segfault
* `leaks`* : the _asm_ file provided has some leaks (with the `-l` option only)
* `error` :
 * both program created a _.cor_ file, their content differ
 * one of the program did not create the file (encounter a parsing error maybe)


 \* a `.leak` folder stores the valgrind output of the faulty check

#### Usage
```
Usage:   ./asm_checker.sh [-chl] <asm> [<player>...]

    -l             check for leaks
    -c             clean directory at first
    -h             print this message and exit
    <asm>          path to your asm executable file
    <champion>...  path to the champions to test, if empty use a set of predefined champs
````


## Vm checker

Assuming your `corewar` file is in the parent directory, you can use the script to run it against a set of _.cor_ file (provided in the repo)
```
./vm_checker.sh ../corewar champs/bytecode/*.cor
```

You can check for potential leaks (requires valgrind). This is compatible with all the other options.
```
./vm_checker.sh -l ../corewar champs/bytecode/*.cor
```
In case of leaks, the valgrind ouptut is stored in the `.leaks` folder in your current directory.

If you get some `timeout`, you can change the value with the `-t` option (set to 20 seconds in the following example)
```
./vm_checker.sh -lt 20 ../corewar champs/bytecode/*.cor
```

You can also use a mixed set of `.s` and `.cor` file as arguments, for this run with the `-b` option to use the _asm_ provided by 42. To use your _asm_ file, use `-B <path_to_your_asm>` (the second example will also check for _leaks_, may take some time due to the length of the provided set)
```
./vm_checker.sh -b ../corewar champs/unit_tests/**/*.s
./vm_checker.sh -bl -B ../asm ../corewar champs/**/*.{s,cor}
```

#### Fight mode
There is a **fight mode** available. You need to specify the number of game to run and the script will randomly generate a set of 2, 3 or 4 champions for each game. Or you can fix the number of contestants with the `-m` option.  
The following command will run 25 time your _corewar_ with a set of 3 champions randomly chosen in the provided set.
```
./vm_checker.sh -f 25 -m 3 ../corewar champs/bytecode/*.cor
```

With the `-p` option, you can ask for a champion to fight in each game
```
./vm_checker.sh -f 10 -m 2 -p ../your_champion ../corewar champs/bytecode/*.cor
```

#### Diff mode
In order to ease our development and debug, we chose to follow Zaz's verbose mode and output. There is a `-d` option to run _diff_ against Zaz's output. You can set the verbose mode with the `-v` option
```
./vm_checker.sh -dv 31 ../corewar champs/bytecode/zork.cor
```
If the outputs differ, a diff file is stored under the `.diff` folder.

#### Usage
```
Usage:   ./vm_checker.sh [-abcdhl] [-t N] [-v N] [-f N] [-F N] [-m <1|2|3|4>]
                         [-p <player>] [-B <asm>] <corewar> <player>...

      -a                 enable aff operator
      -b                 convert all player file with an extension different to .cor into bytecode first
      -c                 clean directory at first
      -d                 enable diff mode
      compare exec output with corewar exec provided by 42 (zaz's corewar)
      -h                 print this message and exit
      -l                 check for leaks
      -t N               timeout value in seconds (default 10 seconds)
      -v N               verbose mode (mode should be between 0 and 31)
      -f N               enable fight mode, run N fights
      if enabled use the set of players to randomly populate
      the arena with 2, 3 or 4 players and let them fight,
      each player is unique in the arena
      -F N               same as -f except that a player can fight against himself
      -m <1|2|3|4>       set the number of contestants (works only in fight mode)
      -p <player>        define a fixed contestant that will appear in all fights (works only in fight mode)
      -B <asm>           path to the asm executable to use to convert into bytecode with -b option (default
      to asm provided by 42) assume that the .cor file is created with the same
      pathname than the input file
      <corewar>          path to your corewar executable
      <player>...        list of players (.cor file, or .s file with the -b option)
```

### Dump checker
In order to check that the memory does not diverge from the reference, we have
developed a script called `dump_checker.sh` to help find where the memory
diverges if this is the case.  
Because your output may differ from the reference output, you need to adapt the
script in the first place to be able to use it (it does a diff on the outputs).   
Basically you need to provide the name of the option you use to dump the memory
(default to `-dump`), the number of bytes on one line (default to `32`) and if
you are using colors or any other formatting, you can clean your output by
piping some commands in `CLEAN_OUTPUT`.
Those commands are stored in the following variables :

* `REMOVE_TRAILING_SPACE` : to remove a trailing space
* `REMOVE_TRAILING_SPACES` : same but for multiple spaces
* `KEEP_ONLY_MEMORY_WITH_ADDRESSES` : runs a `grep` to only keep the part of the output with the memory dump (used for Zaz's output)
* `KEEP_ONLY_MEMORY_BY_DUMP_SIZE` : runs a `grep` to extract the part with the dumped memory, uses a regex to extract `DUMP_SIZE` of 2 hexadecimal numbers followed by an optional space
* `REMOVE_ADDRESSES` : remove the addresses in Zaz's output
* `REMOVE_NON_PRINT_AND_FORMATTING_CHARS` : clean the output if colors and formatting are used

Because all these commands are piped, beware of the order you call them.  
Of course you can add your own pipe to the `CLEAN_OUTPUT` variable.

Once you have adapted the script, use the following command to run the script.
```
./dump_checker.sh ../corewar champs/bytecode/zork.cor champs/bytecode/ultima.cor
```
Here two champions will be loaded and the script will check if the dumped memory
differ. In case the outputs differ, the script will try to find the first cycle
where each output diverge and the diff is then stored in the `diff_output.tmp`
file. 

#### Usage
```
Usage:  ./dump_checker.sh <corewar> <player> [...]

    <corewar>     path to your executable
    <player>      list of players to use

```

## Unit tests
The repo has a set of unit tests under the `champs/unit_tests/` folder. Some of the tests are hard coded, others (for the op) can be generated by a script.  
Composition of the `champs/unit_tests` folder :
* `valid/` : set of hard coded tests that we assume should be valid
* `invalid/` : set of hard coded tests that we assume should fail
* `list.txt` : formatted file used by the `op_asm_gen.sh` script to create some _.s_ file
* `op_asm_gen.sh` : script that parse the `list.txt` file and create _.s_ file in the provided folder
* `test_op/` : folder with the tests created from the `list.txt` and `op_asm_gen.sh` files

Here is how is formatted the `list.txt` file :
```
(1) op_number; (2) op_name; (3) test name; (4) op args [; (5)]
```
1. number of the op
2. name of the op
3. some more specific text about the test
4. the args of the op
5. (optional) a set of operation to perform before the op to test, this set should be separated by ';'  
(see _zjmp_ unit tests for an exemple)

For instance,
```
01;live;dir value is null;%0
```
will produce the following file `01_live-dir_value_is_null.s` with the following code :
```
.name "live"
.comment "live: dir value is null"

live %0
```
